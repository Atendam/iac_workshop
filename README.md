### Infrastructure as Code: Automate all the Things!

This hands-on workshop guides participants through the steps necessary to stand up a Linux environment in AWS using terraform. The often confusing and sometimes complicated steps necessary to build out hosts in AWS are reduced to repeatable recipes which are easily stored and in Github. Further provisioning steps will be accomplished using puppet, hiera, and facter.
